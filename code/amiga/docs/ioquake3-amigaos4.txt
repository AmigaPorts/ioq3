* ioquake3 for AmigaOS 4


ioquake3 is the Quake 3 project maintained by icculus.org. The AmigaOS 4 version
merges the changes from Thomas Frieden's original AmigaOS 4 port with ioquake3.


* Requirements

- AmigaOS 4.0 (version 4.1 recommended)
- MiniGL (version 2.0 recommended)
- Warp3D-capable video card
- Original Quake 3 Arena data (.pk3 files)
- 1.32 patch for data files


* Installation


1) Extract the .pk3 files to baseq3/ directory.
2) Install patch data over .pk3 files from http://ioquake3.org/patch-data/
3) Now you should be able to start the game with ioquake3 executable

Please note that ioquake3 uses internal "stack cookie" of 2000000 bytes to avoid
potential issues with stack.


* Release notes

xx/Oct/08

xx/Oct/08

- latest SVN changes


* Known issues

- Occasional system lock-ups in menu mode. Probably a Warp3D issue.
- When playing against the bots, Q3 may write a route cache files that seem
to cause problem when revisiting the same arena later (causing a zero page hit).
A work around is to remove cache file from baseq3/maps


* Reporting bugs

If you find a bug, please send a detailed bug report including at least these:

- reproduction steps
- hardware configuration: motherboard type, CPU, memory size, video card, sound card etc
- software configuration: AmigaOS 4 version, Warp3d driver version and MiniGL version
- crashlogs
